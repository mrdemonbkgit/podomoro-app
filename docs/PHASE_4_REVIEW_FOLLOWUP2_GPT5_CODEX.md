# Phase 4 Review – Follow-Up #2 (gpt-5-codex)

## Verification

- ✅ `src/features/kamehameha/constants/app.constants.ts:1-20` now carries a short summary comment and exports only the two active interval values (`UPDATE_DISPLAY_MS`, `MILESTONE_CHECK_MS`). `POLLING_MS` has been removed, and a repo-wide search confirms no lingering references.
- ✅ `src/features/kamehameha/hooks/useStreaks.ts:1-4` and `useMilestones.ts:1-4` retain concise inline summaries with no `@see docs/...` annotations; runtime files are no longer coupled to doc paths.

## Status

All outstanding Phase 4 issues are resolved. No further changes requested.

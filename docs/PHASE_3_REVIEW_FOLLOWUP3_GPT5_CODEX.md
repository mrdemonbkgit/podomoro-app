# Phase 3 Review Follow-Up (Round 3) – gpt-5-codex

## Verification

- ✅ `functions/src/scheduledMilestones.ts:40-49` now queries `collectionGroup('kamehameha')` with `FieldPath.documentId() == 'streaks'`, allowing it to find the existing streak documents and continue filtering by `currentJourneyId`.
- ✅ `firestore.indexes.json` includes a `kamehameha` collection-group index on `__name__` and `currentJourneyId`, so the new query has the required composite index.
- ✅ README and function export comments match the restored behaviour: scheduled execution now operates alongside the client hook as the intended offline fallback.

## Status

All outstanding Phase 3 issues are resolved; no further changes requested.

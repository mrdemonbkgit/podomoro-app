## 🔄 Deployment Method

**Auto-Deployment via GitHub Integration**

When code is pushed to `main` branch, Vercel automatically:
1. Detects the push
2. Pulls the latest code
3. Runs build process (`npm run build`)
4. Deploys to production

**Push Command:**
```bash
git push origin main
# Pushed: f6c0df9..ec2b954
```

**Result:** 133 commits pushed to GitHub

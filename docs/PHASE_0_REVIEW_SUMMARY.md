## ‚ùå What's Missing (2 tasks)

### 1. Quick Win #4 - Clean Deprecated Code ‚ùå
**Issue:** #3 - Deprecated milestones.js still compiled
**Status:** NOT DONE
**Evidence:**
```bash
$ ls functions/lib/milestones.js
-rwxrwxrwx 1 tony tony 7512 Oct 24 05:59 milestones.js  ‚ùå Still exists
```

**Fix Time:** 5 minutes
**Severity:** LOW (cosmetic issue)

---

### 2. Quick Win #5 - Centralize Paths & Fix Deletes ‚ùå
**Issue:** #10 - Delete operations use wrong paths
**Status:** Only scanner created (1 of 8 steps done)
**Evidence:**
```bash
$ ls src/features/kamehameha/services/paths.ts
ls: cannot access 'src/features/kamehameha/services/paths.ts': No such file or directory  ‚ùå

$ npm run scan:paths
‚ö†Ô∏è  Hardcoded path in: useMilestones.ts
‚ö†Ô∏è  Hardcoded path in: firestoreService.ts
‚ö†Ô∏è  Hardcoded path in: journeyService.ts
‚ùå Found hardcoded paths.
```

**Fix Time:** 1-1.5 hours
**Severity:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH (Production Bug)**

**Impact:** Users cannot delete check-ins or relapses!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 1

**Why:**
1. Delete operations broken (production bug)
2. Quick Wins not actually complete
3. Issue #10 still unresolved

**Required Actions:**
1. Complete Quick Win #4 (5 min)
2. Complete Quick Win #5 (1.5 hours)
3. Create new tag `v2.2-phase0-corrected`
4. THEN proceed to Phase 1

# Phase 4 Review — Polish & Documentation (Days 1–4)

## Executive Summary

- Phase 4 delivered on its scope: milestone constant validation, magic-number extraction, comprehensive API documentation, and a final polish pass.
- Code quality and DX improved materially (named constants, clear warnings, solid docs). No breaking changes detected.
- Approved with minor notes (see Findings).

## Scope Verified

- Day 1: Milestone constants sync + validation tests
- Day 2: Magic numbers → `app.constants.ts`; replaced across hooks/components
- Day 3: API documentation (`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`) with examples and JSDoc enhancements
- Day 4: Type checks, lint, test suite, and final cleanup

## Strengths

- Sync warnings present in both milestone constant files (frontend/backend), reinforcing dual-source consistency:
```1:15:src/features/kamehameha/constants/milestones.ts
/**
 * Frontend Milestone Constants
 * ...
 * ⚠️ SYNC WARNING: This file must be kept in sync with:
 * Backend: functions/src/milestoneConstants.ts
 * ...
 */
```
```1:13:functions/src/milestoneConstants.ts
/**
 * Milestone definitions for badge system
 * ...
 * ⚠️ SYNC WARNING: This file must be kept in sync with:
 * Frontend: src/features/kamehameha/constants/milestones.ts
 * ...
 */
```
- Clear milestone thresholds and matching badge configs on both sides:
```27:39:src/features/kamehameha/constants/milestones.ts
export const MILESTONE_SECONDS = isDevelopment
  ? [60, 300]
  : [86400, 259200, 604800, 1209600, 2592000, 5184000, 7776000, 15552000, 31536000];
```
```18:31:functions/src/milestoneConstants.ts
export const MILESTONE_SECONDS = isEmulator
  ? [60, 300]
  : [86400, 259200, 604800, 1209600, 2592000, 5184000, 7776000, 15552000, 31536000];
```
- Magic numbers extracted and used consistently:
```11:20:src/features/kamehameha/constants/app.constants.ts
export const INTERVALS = { UPDATE_DISPLAY_MS: 1000, MILESTONE_CHECK_MS: 1000, POLLING_MS: 5000 } as const;
```
```190:201:src/features/kamehameha/hooks/useStreaks.ts
updateIntervalRef.current = setInterval(() => { updateDisplay(); }, INTERVALS.UPDATE_DISPLAY_MS);
```
```153:161:src/features/kamehameha/hooks/useMilestones.ts
checkIntervalRef.current = setInterval(checkMilestones, INTERVALS.MILESTONE_CHECK_MS);
```
```23:60:src/features/kamehameha/components/CelebrationModal.tsx
const duration = TIMEOUTS.TOAST_DURATION_MS;
...
const autoCloseTimer = setTimeout(onClose, TIMEOUTS.ERROR_MESSAGE_MS);
```
- API documentation is comprehensive and aligned with code (hooks/services/types/constants), with runnable examples:
```17:35:docs/API_REFERENCE.md
## React Hooks
...
interface UseStreaksReturn { ... }
```

## Findings (Minor)

1) Duplicate milestone thresholds inside `useMilestones` (import from constants)
- The hook declares its own `MILESTONE_SECONDS`/badge configs instead of importing from `src/features/kamehameha/constants/milestones.ts`. Prefer importing to keep a single frontend source of truth and rely on existing sync tests.

2) Celebration timeout semantics
- `CelebrationModal` uses `TIMEOUTS.TOAST_DURATION_MS` for confetti cadence and `TIMEOUTS.ERROR_MESSAGE_MS` for auto-close. Consider introducing `CELEBRATION_ANIMATION_MS` and `CELEBRATION_AUTO_CLOSE_MS` to avoid semantic confusion.

3) Unused constants (non-blocking)
- Some values in `LIMITS` (e.g., display caps) may not be wired yet. Not harmful; document intent or remove if not planned soon.

4) Tests location and CI
- Docs reference `src/features/kamehameha/__tests__/milestoneConstants.test.ts` and `"test:milestones"` script. Ensure the test file is committed and the script runs in CI.

## Recommendations

- Refactor `useMilestones` to import thresholds/configs from `constants/milestones.ts`.
- Add celebration-specific constants for clarity.
- Confirm milestone validation tests are present and running in CI.

## Conclusion

Phase 4 meets its goals with strong improvements to maintainability and developer experience. Approved with minor notes.

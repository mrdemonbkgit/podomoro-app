Reviewer: gpt-5
Phase: 2.5 — CI/CD Pipeline (ESLint, Prettier, GH Actions, Rules Tests)
Tag under review: phase-2.5-complete

---

## Executive Summary

Status: PASS — CI/CD pipeline implemented as specified; high-value checks automated.

- GitHub Actions workflow present with 5 jobs: frontend-quality, functions-quality, code-quality, firestore-rules, status-check.
- ESLint and Prettier configured; package scripts updated; lint-staged pre-commit integration in place.
- Local CI run shows typecheck/build/tests executing; minor warnings only.
- Functions build step explicitly guards against deprecated compiled files.

## Evidence (code references)

- Workflow file and jobs:
```1:20:.github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  frontend-quality:
    name: Frontend Quality Checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '22'
        cache: 'npm'
```

- Functions deprecated build guard:
```75:83:.github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Verify no deprecated code compiled
  working-directory: ./functions
  run: |
    if [ -f "lib/milestones.js" ]; then
      echo "❌ Deprecated milestones.js found in build!"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "✅ No deprecated files in build"
```

- Code quality scanners wired:
```101:106:.github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Check for console.log statements
  run: npm run scan:console

- name: Check for hardcoded paths
  run: npm run scan:paths
```

- Firestore rules tests job:
```124:135:.github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Setup Java (for Firestore Emulator)
  uses: actions/setup-java@v4
  with:
    distribution: 'temurin'
    java-version: '17'

- name: Install Firebase CLI
  run: npm install -g firebase-tools

- name: Test Firestore rules
  run: npm run test:rules
```

- Package scripts and devDependencies (excerpt):
```1:23:package.json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest run",
  "test:rules": "vitest run firestore.rules.test.ts",
  "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
  "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts,.tsx",
  "format:check": "prettier --check \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\""
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@firebase/rules-unit-testing": "^5.0.0",
  "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0",
  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.9.1",
  "vitest": "^3.2.4"
}
```

## Findings

- CI jobs cover typechecking, linting, formatting, unit tests, frontend build, functions build, code scans, and rules tests.
- Emulator setup for rules tests included; good for CI reliability.
- Pre-commit hooks run TypeScript; CI adds ESLint + Prettier for stronger gates.

---

## Suggestions (Non-blocking)

1) Add a separate coverage job (optional) to publish coverage HTML as artifact.
2) Consider caching Firebase CLI or using an action to speed up runs.
3) Add a small “How CI works” section in README referencing `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for new contributors.

---

## Verdict

PASS — Phase 2.5 is complete and robust. CI/CD is in good shape for Phase 4 and production hardening.

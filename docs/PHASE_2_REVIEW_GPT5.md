# Phase 2 Review Report (gpt-5)

Date: October 26, 2025
Reviewer: gpt-5
Phase: 2 — Testing & Stability (Infrastructure, Service/Hook/Integration Tests, Error Boundary, Rules Tests)
Tag under review: phase-2-complete

---

## Executive Summary

Status: PASS — Phase 2 work is complete and aligns with the plan.

- Test infrastructure established (Vitest + jsdom; testing-library packages; MSW placeholder).
- Service, hook, and integration tests present in expected directories; rules tests implemented.
- ErrorBoundary implemented and uses `logger.error` for production-safe logging.
- package.json includes scripts for test runs and rules tests; dev dependencies installed.

Minor follow-ups noted (non-blocking) to tighten CI and emulator prerequisites for rules tests.

## Evidence (code references)

- Vitest config (jsdom + setup):
```1:14:vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: './src/test/setup.ts',
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      exclude: [
```

- Error boundary implementation:
```10:25:src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
import { Component, ErrorInfo, ReactNode } from 'react';
import { logger } from '../utils/logger';

interface Props {
  children: ReactNode;
  fallback?: ReactNode;
}

interface State {
  hasError: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
  errorInfo: ErrorInfo | null;
}
```

- Rules tests present and initialized via `@firebase/rules-unit-testing`:
```22:31:firestore.rules.test.ts
import { describe, test, expect, beforeAll, beforeEach, afterAll } from 'vitest';
import {
  assertFails,
  assertSucceeds,
  initializeTestEnvironment,
  RulesTestEnvironment,
} from '@firebase/rules-unit-testing';
import { doc, getDoc, setDoc, updateDoc, deleteDoc, collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
```

- Tests exist in expected locations:
```1:3:src/features/kamehameha/services/__tests__/streakCalculations.test.ts
// ... service tests ...
```
```1:3:src/features/kamehameha/hooks/__tests__/useStreaks.test.ts
// ... hook tests ...
```
```1:3:src/features/kamehameha/__tests__/integration/journey-lifecycle.test.ts
// ... integration test ...
```

- package.json scripts and devDependencies:
```1:23:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:rules": "vitest run firestore.rules.test.ts",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@firebase/rules-unit-testing": "^5.0.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.6.1",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.9.1",
    "vitest": "^3.2.4"
  }
}
```

---

## Findings

- Test scaffolding is sound; directories follow the plan and naming is consistent.
- ErrorBoundary implements standard lifecycle (`getDerivedStateFromError`, `componentDidCatch`) and logs via `logger.error`.
- Rules tests cover authentication ownership, subcollections, unauthenticated denial, and dev test user access warnings.

---

## Suggestions (Non-blocking)

1) Add CI job to run `npm run test:rules` with emulator startup (GitHub Actions service or pre-step) to avoid false positives if emulator isn’t running.
2) Ensure `src/test/setup.ts` includes `@testing-library/jest-dom` import for matchers if not already present.
3) Consider minimum coverage thresholds for critical paths (streak reset, milestone detection, badge creation).

---

## Verdict

PASS — Phase 2 is complete and correct. Ready to proceed to Phase 3 (Performance & Quality) as per the implementation plan.

# Phase 5 Implementation Plan — Review (gpt‑5‑codex)

## Verdict
- Plan keeps focus on the right production blockers, but a few action steps would regress the system or fail during execution.
- Before execution, fix the issues below and clarify expectations around metadata preservation and testing.

## Findings
- **docs/PHASE_5_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:138-150 (High)** — The transactional client snippet drops `createdBy` and `updatedAt`, fields that current writes persist (`src/features/kamehameha/hooks/useMilestones.ts:57`, `:70-76`). Removing them would break existing tests (`src/features/kamehameha/hooks/__tests__/useMilestones.test.ts:107`) and degrade auditability.
- **docs/PHASE_5_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:189-214 (High)** — The server transaction example omits the same metadata (`createdBy`, journey `updatedAt`). Today’s scheduled function stores `createdBy: 'scheduled_function'` and bumps `updatedAt` (`functions/src/scheduledMilestones.ts:169-187`). Copying the plan verbatim would regress production data quality.
- **docs/PHASE_5_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:407-423 (High)** — Firebase CLI does not honour an emulator-only `rules` override inside `firebase.json`. With the current config (`firebase.json:1-23`), the emulator would still load `firestore.rules`, so the production backdoor remains. We need an alternative (e.g., swap files in a script or load via CLI flag).
- **docs/PHASE_5_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:262-287 (Medium)** — The proposed concurrency test calls `createBadgeAtomic`, which isn’t exported, and it never seeds the journey document that the transaction updates. Both calls will reject, so the test is not executable as written.

## Questions
- Do we want to keep `createdBy` / `updatedAt` mandatory post-transaction? If so, the plan should call out preserving them explicitly.

## Recommended Tweaks Before Implementation
1. Update both transaction snippets to preserve existing badge and journey metadata (`createdBy`, `updatedAt`), ensuring parity with current writes and tests.
2. Replace the emulator-rules advice with a workable approach (e.g., script that swaps `firestore.rules.dev` in before starting the emulator, then swaps back).
3. Rework the race-condition test plan: expose a real helper or drive the flow through public APIs, and seed prerequisite documents so the transaction can succeed.
4. Capture the answer to the metadata question above so implementation agents know the expected contract.

Once these are addressed, the rest of the implementation plan reads sound.

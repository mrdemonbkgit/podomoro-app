# Phase 2.5 Review Follow-Up – gpt-5-codex

## Verification

- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml:133` now wraps the rules suite in `firebase emulators:exec --only firestore`, so the emulator spins up before `npm run test:rules` executes and shuts down cleanly after completion.
- ✅ `package.json` lint scripts were updated to `eslint src` / `eslint src --fix`, matching the ESLint 9 flat-config expectations.
- ✅ `prettier@^3.6.2` is listed in `devDependencies`, enabling the new formatting scripts and lint-staged hook.

## Status

All previously raised issues for Phase 2.5 are resolved; no further changes requested.

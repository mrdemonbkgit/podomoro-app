# Phase 2 Review Follow-Up (Round 4) – gpt-5-codex

## Findings

- **Resolved – Concurrent relapse assertion**  
  - Location: `src/features/kamehameha/__tests__/integration/journey-lifecycle.test.ts:322-343`  
  - The test now inspects the returned `Relapse` objects (mapping to their `id`s and checking key fields), aligning with the service contract. This fixes the prior shape mismatch.

- **No additional issues observed**  
  - Remaining Phase 2 integration tests now exercise real service logic with the corrected Firestore mocks.

## Status

`overall_status: accepted` – All items from the initial review and subsequent follow-ups have been addressed. No further changes requested.

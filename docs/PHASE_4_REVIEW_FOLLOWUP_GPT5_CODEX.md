# Phase 4 Review – Follow-Up (gpt-5-codex)

## Findings

1. **MAJOR – Runtime files still reference docs**  
   - Locations: `src/features/kamehameha/constants/app.constants.ts:1-3`, `src/features/kamehameha/hooks/useStreaks.ts:1-3`, `src/features/kamehameha/hooks/useMilestones.ts:1-3`  
   - The massive tutorials are gone, but each file still carries a doc-block pointing to `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`. Runtime modules should keep inline comments minimal; hard-linking documentation paths in production code reintroduces the same drift risk we flagged earlier.  
   - Recommendation: Replace the doc-blocks with succinct plain-English summaries (no `@see`, no external doc references).

2. **MAJOR – `POLLING_MS` constant remains unused**  
   - Location: `src/features/kamehameha/constants/app.constants.ts:13`  
   - The deprecated polling interval is still exported even though the codebase no longer polls. Shipping unused constants invites accidental reuse and confuses future maintainers about whether polling still exists.  
   - Recommendation: Remove `POLLING_MS` outright (or reinstate the polling logic—preferably delete).

## Requested Actions

- Drop the `@see docs/...` references from runtime files.
- Delete `INTERVALS.POLLING_MS`.

Resubmit Phase 4 once those are addressed.

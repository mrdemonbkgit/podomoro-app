## 🎵 How It Works

### The Hybrid System

The app now uses a **hybrid audio system**:

1. **Check for Real File**: When you play a sound, the system first checks if a real audio file exists
2. **Use Real File**: If found, it preloads and plays the MP3 file
3. **Fallback to Synthesis**: If file is missing/fails, it automatically uses Web Audio API synthesis
4. **Zero Errors**: System always works, regardless of file availability

### Sound Breakdown

- **7 Sounds with Real Audio Files** (from your downloads)
- **20 Sounds with Synthesis** (Web Audio API generation)
- **27 Total Ambient Sounds** available

---

## ✨ Features Enabled

### 1. Multi-Track Sound Mixing
- Play multiple sounds simultaneously
- Each sound has independent volume control
- Real-time mixing with no latency

### 2. Quick Presets
All presets now use your real audio files:
- 🎯 **Deep Focus**: Rain (real file) + Coffee Shop (real file) + Pink Noise (synthesis)
- 💼 **Productive**: Office (real file) + Typing (real file) + Coffee Shop (real file)
- 😴 **Sleep**: Heavy Rain (synthesis) + White Noise (synthesis)

### 3. Category Organization
- 🌿 Nature (1 real file: Rain)
- 🏙️ Urban (1 real file: Subway)
- 💼 Workspace (5 real files: Coffee Shop, Keyboard, Library, Office, Fan)
- Plus 20 synthesized sounds in other categories
